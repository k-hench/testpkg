# The testpkg Package

This is a small demo of a R package created with {usethis}.
It makes use of the helper packages {usethis}, {devtools}, {roxygen2} and {pkgdown} to quickly wrap R code into R packages.

To install this package please run this in R:

```
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("k-hench/testpkg")
```

But honestly --- there is not really a good reason for you to install this ^^
